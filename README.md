### (1) BEFORE YOU START

-  Download the entire data set including the raw files, and the R script. The script was tested on Windows and Mac under the R Version 3.8  

- Do not change the order structure or rename the files, this may cause errors in the script.

- Note that the .csv files represent the output from DeepLabCut. We have randomly selected representative videos to give you an example of the data processing. Due to the random selection the output files do not necessarily show the same findings as described in the manuscript. If your set-up is different you may need to adapt the script. You are welcome to contact ruslan.rust@irem.uzh.ch for further help / collaboration.
